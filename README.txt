With a bit of reverse engineering, I was capable of understanding the code using the inspect editor to get specific element classes and IDs to edit the code into adding the extra functionality.


## The code has few issues:
# Spaghetti code.
# doesn't respect camel case norm in naming variables and functions
# repetitive code and doesn't respect the DRY conceptÂ 
# has issues with adding players functionality; only fetched data from the json file works
